# ðŸš€ LLMedic 

Customising Large Language Models for clinical workflows could improve healthcare delivery, but their
integration is constrained by regulatory requirements and cliniciansâ€™ limited technical expertise. Existing
fine-tuning frameworks are dependent on technical setup and lack clinician-centred interfaces, limiting
the practical application of LLMs in healthcare. To address these challenges, we developed LLMedic, an
on-premise platform leveraging Intel Gaudi 2 hardware that allows clinicians to discover open-source models,
fine-tune them locally, apply prompt-engineering strategies (Chain-of-Thought, Few-shot), and compare
different model outputs. LLMedic uses a modular microservices architecture for modular development and
robust handling of long-running operations.

## Deployment

1. Clone both repos

```
git clone git@github.com:Project-Ambience/web-demo.git
```

```
git clone git@github.com:Project-Ambience/endpoints.git
```

2. Create .env (copy and paste .env into your file)

```
cd web-demo
nano .env
```

3. Run deploy script

```
cd ~/endpoints
chmod +x ./admin/deploy_llmedic.sh
./admin/deploy_llmedic.sh dev
```

## Run in local (with docker)

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.rabbitmq.yml up --build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec api bin/rails db:migrate
(optional) docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec api bin/rails db:seed
```
The app will available at port 5090
